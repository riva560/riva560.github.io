        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>I am currently a sophomore at Northwestern University studying Computer Science with a minor in Business Institutions.
            Some areas that interest me are financial technology, educationn technology research, and web development.</p>

        <p>
            This past summer, I had the opportunity to work in a finanacial technology start-up called Redstone Funding. I worked as a 
            Software Engineering Intern, with an emphasis on front-end development. During this internship, I designed dashboards for 
            multiple departments within the company, researched their underwriting process and suggested improvements, and created web 
            versions of their daily rate charts. I am currently still working as a part-time employee for Redstone Funding, focusing on 
            more front-end development projects using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of my hobbies include painting, baking, and hiking with my family. I also have been playing the piano since 
            I was 6 years old, and I continue to play especially when I want to destress. My favorite piece to play is called
            Mia and Sebastian's theme composed by Justin Hurwitz. You can listen to it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwIyb6M6Aks">here!</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            I also love to travel whenever possible. I have visited India to visit my family multiple times, and my first trip was when I was 3 months old.
            My favorite place I have been to so far is Lisbon, Portugal. I would love to visit more places in Europe and South America in the future.
